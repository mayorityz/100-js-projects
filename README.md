Last year, I saw an instagram ad for 101 js projects, written by GEORGE FIELD.

*Turns out they are 100*

I have decided to work through all of them as they are really interesting. And I think that they will certainly do a world of good to anyone.

I will be updating this repo with each completed project. 

Also, I may skip the simpler ones at the beginning, but certainly fill out what we expected!

Cheers!
